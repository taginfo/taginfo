                <p>Taginfo takes data about OSM tags from several sources and brings them
                together for easy browsing and discovery.</p>

                href="http://www.sqlite.org/">Sqlite</a> databases. The database files are then

                <p>If you don't want to download these databases, but need automated access to
                the data, you can also use the <a href="/about">API</a>.</p>

        name: Characters in keys
        intro: |
            <p>Any valid Unicode character can appear in an OSM key but usually only lower
            case latin letters (a-z) and the underscore (_) are used. Sometimes the colon
            (:) is added as a separator character.</p>
        statistics:
            tab: Statistics
            title: Statistics Overview
            characters_in_keys:
                plain: Only latin lowercase letters (<span class="char">a</span> to <span class="char">z</span>) and underscore (<span class="char">_</span>), first and last characters are letters.
                colon: Like A but with one or more colons (<span class="char">:</span>) inside.
                letters: Like B but with uppercase latin letters or letters from other alphabets.
                space: Like C but contains at least one whitespace character (space, tab, new line, carriage return, or from other alphabets).
                problem: Like C but contains possibly problematic characters <span class="char">=+/&amp;&lt;&gt;;'"?%#@\,</span>.
                rest: Everything else.
        whitespace:
            tab: Whitespace
            title: Keys With Whitespace
            intro: |
                <p>Keys that contain whitespace characters such as space, tab, new
                line, carriage return, or whitespace characters from other
                alphabets.<br/>
                Whitespace in keys can be confusing, especially at the
                beginning or end of the key, because they are invisible. Generally
                the underscore (_) should be used instead.</p>
        problematic:
            tab: Problematic
            title: Keys With Possibly Problematic Characters
            intro: |
                <p>Keys that contain possibly problematic characters: <span
                class="char">=+/&amp;&lt;&gt;;'"?%#@\,</span>. These characters
                can be problematic, because they are used to quote strings in
                different programming languages or have special meanings in XML, HTML,
                URLs, and other places. The equal sign is used often as separator
                between tag keys and values.<br/>
                Keys that appear in this list are not necessarily wrong though. But
                in many cases they are just results of some error.</p>

            <p>This table shows all tag keys for which there are wiki pages available and in what languages they are.</p>
    languages:
        name: Languages
        intro: |
            <p>OpenStreetMap is an international project. Tags and their descriptions can
            be in any language. This table lists the languages Taginfo knows about and how
            many wiki pages there are in these languages documenting keys and tags,
            respectively.</p>
    wiki_pages_about_non_existing_keys:
        name: Wiki pages about non-existing keys
        intro: |
            <p>This table shows keys for which a wiki page exists but there is not a single
            instance in the database. This is not necessarily an error (maybe somebody
            added the documentation in the wiki as preparation for using a key or the wiki
            page documents a now obsolete key), but it can also be a typo or other error.</p>
